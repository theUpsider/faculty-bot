# Faculty bot (Discord)

## Introduction

This project features a Discord bot with the intent to reduce the administration overhead for faculty related tasks. The bot takes care of verifying new server members.

## Setting up the bot

- To run the code itself, first you need [The Rust Programming Language](https://rust-lang.org).
  Install this using `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh` and choose the `stable` toolchain
- You need to download the project and execute  
  `cargo build --release` inside the primary folder using Windows Terminal or any zsh/bash on *nix systems. This will compile a release optimized build of the bot


- Create a `.env` file with the following content:
```sh
DISCORD_TOKEN=

# PostgreSQL format e.g. postgres://dbuser:dbpass@localhost:5432/db_name
DATABASE_URL=

PREFIX=

MAILUSER=
MAILPW=
SMTP_SERVER=
SMTP_PORT=

POSTGRES_USER=
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=
POSTGRES_DB=

# optional, but recommended if you want logs
RUST_LOG=warn
```

- To register the bot, you'll need to register an application at [Discord's Developer Portal](https://discord.dev) The Token should be filled in the `.env` file under `DISCORD_TOKEN` key.

## Launching
- Fill the `.env` and the `config.json`

- Easiest: Take a look at the `docker-compose.yml` file and edit accordingly
  - then launch with ` docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml --env-file .env up`
- Easy: Use either the `launch_bot.sh` or `launch_bot.ps1` scripts
- Hard: 
  - Install `Postgres 13`
  - The Rust Toolchain
  - Run the `faculty_manager.sql` file to init the database
  - Use your favourite Process Manager to keep the bot running
    (Notable Mentions: [pm2](https://pm2.io), systemd, openrc)

In order for the bot to communicate with channels, you need to edit the `config.json` and paste in the Id's of the channels and roles. 
Those need to be created before launching the bot.
